EVERYNIGHT I LOOK TO THE SKIES
AND WONDER WHAT WE DID
ALWAYS A NAIVE POINT OF VIEW
THAT BREAKS US IN THE END
IF I COULD FIND THE MEANING OF
IT ALL I'D TAKE THE CHANCE
MAYBE IN TIME WE'LL WALK
THE MILE AND CHANGE
IT IF WE CAN
IT'S NOW AND ALWAYS
HOW DID WE GET THIS FAR
WE'RE MAKING A BRAND NEW START
NOTHING WILL HOLD ME DOWN
WAVE GOODBYE TO ME!
AROUND THE WORLD
新しいことに
フミダスチカラで
世界は変わるさ
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE
IF IT'S NOT OK!
I'LL CHANGE THAT WORLD
INTO SOMETHING BETTER HONEY!
<♪>
果てしなく広がる
この大地(みち)を
僕らはまた歩き続けるさ
全ての意味が分かるのならば
この瞳で何を見つめるのだろう
IT'S NOW AND ALWAYS
HOW DID WE GET THIS FAR
WE'RE MAKING A BRAND NEW START
NOTHING WILL HOLD ME DOWN
WAVE GOODBYE TO ME!
AROUND THE WORLD
君だけのために
探し続けるよ
奇跡のかけらを
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE
IF IT'S NOT OK!
AND YOU KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE RAINING
AND YOU KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
AS LONG AS WE TRUST EACH OTHER
NOTHINGS GONNA
BREAK APART OH NO! NO!
IF YA WANNA BE SOMEBODY
GET UP ON YA FEET AND GO
I KNOW WERE GONNA
MEET EACH OTHER
SOMEWHERE AROUND THE GLOBE
AROUND THE WORLD
いつでも自分に
負けている人は
何も掴めない
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE
IF IT'S NOT OK!
BUT DON'T RUN AWAY 'CAUSE
IF IT'S NOT OK!
I'LL CHANGE THAT WORLD
INTO SOMETHING BETTER HONEY!
