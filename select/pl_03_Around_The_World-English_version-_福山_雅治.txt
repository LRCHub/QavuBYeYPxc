Everynight I look to skies
and wonder what we did
Always a naive point of view
that breaks us in the end
If I could find the meaning of
It all I'd take the chance
Maybe in time we'll walk the
mile and change it if we can
it's now and always
How did we get this far
Always…
we're making a brand new start
Always…
nothing will hold me down
Always…
wave goodbye to me!
Around the world
I'll find out why we came to be
Around the world
The secret lies inside of he
Around the world
I'll find the hero inside me
But don't run away
'cause if it's no ok!
I'll change that world
Into something better
honey!
Night after night we take our
time at searching for the clues
All we can find are situations
hard times to get through
But when we side together
nothing can get in our way
Using our might to fight the
odds now
watch me save the day
It's now and always
How did we get this far
Always…
We're making a brand new start
Always…
nothing will hold me down
Always…
wave goodbye to me!
Around the world
I'll find out why we came to be
Around the world
The secret lies of he
Around the world
I'll find the hero inside me
But don't run away
'cause if it's no ok!
Yeah!
And you know
it's gonna be raining
And you know
it's gonna be hard
As long as we trust each other
Nothing's gonna break apart oh
no! No!
If ya wanna be somebody
Get up on ya feel and go
I know we're gonna meet each
other
Somewhere around the globe
Around the world
I'll find out why we came to be
Around the world
The secret lies inside of he
Around the world
I'll find the hero inside me
But don't run away
'cause if it's no ok!
But don't run away
'cause if it's no ok!
I'll change that world
Into something better
honey!
